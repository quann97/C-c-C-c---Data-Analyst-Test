1.	Logic test — attached. Must be done for 30 minutes.

2.	SQL test — attached. Must be done for 60 minutes.

3.	Calculate: DAU, Facebook DAU, traffic distribution by hours, top 10 domains by traffic. By attached sample clickstream (date, time, user_id, domain). You can choose to use Excel or other programming language like R or Python.

4.	An important metric (e.g Daily active user – DAU) goes down. Suppose we have a lot of user data: clickstream from the browser (basically — user_id, url, timestamp, location), user action logs in every feature, time spent on pages, user hardware and software information, location and so on. We can segment our users by demographics and other criteria. (Note that all these segmentations are probabilistic by nature.) We also can conduct surveys and user interviews. Cốc Cốc ‘s main features are listed on https://coccoc.com/.  
How would you dig into the causes? What kind of ideas (general and specific) do you have? In case you find the causes, how would you identify opportunities for recovering and growth? Suggest metrics to measure and setup goals based on those opportunities.

5.	Assuming that we have Cốc Cốc Browser for Desktop and we are launching Cốc Cốc for mobile, what metrics do you think we should track?

6.	Talking about your first experience of using Cốc Cốc. What feature do you like most? What feature do you expect to have?
